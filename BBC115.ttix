OL,4,CKing penguins face warming challenge
OL,5, King penguins are in deep trouble if
OL,6, nothing is done to constrain climate
OL,7, change, researchers say. 
OL,9,FThe scientists have assessed the birds'
OL,10,Ffragmented population in the Southern
OL,11,FOcean and concluded that some island
OL,12,Fstrongholds will become unsustainable. 
OL,14,FThe problem is the continued movement
OL,15,Faway from key nesting sites of the
OL,16,Fpenguins' favoured foraging grounds. 
OL,18,FAnd as the climate warms further, food
OL,19,Fwill simply become too distant for many
OL,20,Fbirds to fetch for their chicks.
