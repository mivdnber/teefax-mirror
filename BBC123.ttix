OL,5,Con way to Kiev
OL,6, If you celebrate Christmas, you may
OL,7, have spotted a huge tree in your
OL,8, nearest town centre. It might be a
OL,9, longstanding tradition, but
OL,10, conservationists may argue it's
OL,11, unnecessary and damaging to the
OL,12, environment.
OL,15,FHowever, when the tree got stuck in
OL,16,Foverhead electrical wires, and its
OL,17,Fjourney was halted, some on Twitter
OL,18,Fcalled it a 'sign from nature'.
