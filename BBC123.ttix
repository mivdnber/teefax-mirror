OL,5, Scientists have unearthed the
OL,6, fossilised remains of a piranha-like
OL,7, species that they say is the earliest
OL,8, known example of a flesh-eating fish.
OL,10,FThis bony creature, found in South
OL,11,FGermany, lived about 150 million years
OL,12,Fago and had the distinctive sharp teeth
OL,13,Fof modern-day piranhas. 
OL,15,FThese Jurassic marauders used their
OL,16,Frazor teeth to tear chunks of flesh and
OL,17,Ffins off other fish.
OL,19,FOther fish were found nearby which had
OL,20,Fbeen attacked by the ancient piranhas.
