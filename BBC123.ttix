OL,6, thought to have been painted by British
OL,7, artist Sir William Nicholson, could be
OL,8, nearly worthless after an art expert
OL,9, cast doubt on its authenticity.

OL,15,FAn expert said there was not enough
OL,16,Fevidence to confirm who painted it.
OL,18,FHowever, a handwriting expert believes
