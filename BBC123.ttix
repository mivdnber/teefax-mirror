OL,4,CCanada and Norway in moose statue feud
OL,5, Since 1984, residents of Moose Jaw have
OL,6, had one big thing about which they
OL,7, could boast: Mac the Moose.
OL,9,FThe Canadian city was long the proud
OL,10,Fowner of the world's tallest moose
OL,11,Fstatue, a 9.75m (32-foot) steel-framed
OL,12,Fcreature, covered with metal mesh and
OL,13,Fcement.
OL,15,FBut a few years ago, a slightly taller
OL,16,Fmoose statue was erected in Norway,
OL,17,Fbeating Mac's record by some 30cm. 
OL,19,FNow, Moose Jaw has launched a campaign
OL,20,Fto reclaim the crown.
