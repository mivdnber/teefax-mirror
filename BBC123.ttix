OL,4,CChronic fatigue: 'Held hostage by ME'
OL,5, Hi, my name is Lizzie and I'm known in
OL,6, my town as the girl who got ill.
OL,8,FYou see, I was given that label when I
OL,9,Fwas diagnosed with myalgic
OL,10,Fencephalomyelitis (ME) aged 16. 
OL,12,FI'd gone from a bright, bubbly girl to
OL,13,Fbeing exhausted and having my
OL,14,Fpersonality sucked out of me. 
OL,16,FFor those of you who don't know (and
OL,17,FI'm guessing you don't, I certainly
OL,18,Fdidn't) it's a horrible illness that
OL,19,Fmakes you feel tired in a really
OL,20,Fextreme, abnormal way.
