		<h1>Getting started with teletext</h1>
		First design some pages in an editor. An editor lets you
		enter text and graphics within the limitations of the teletext system<br/>
		These editors will run on modern computers:<br/>
		The <a href="http://teletext40.com">teletext40</a> editor is the least fuss and will run
		in any browser. <br/>
		<a href="http://teastop.co.uk/teletext/wxted/">wxTED</a> is a Windows application.
		It has transmission features such as page numbering, carousel subpage sequences, C-flags
		for subtitles, newsflashes etc. It also has a publish feature so you can send your page to an inserter with a click of the mouse.
		</p>
		<p>
		When you have made some pages you will want to show them off. 
		If you have a Raspberry Pi then <a href="http://teastop.co.uk/teletext/vbit/">VBIT-Pi</a> is the cheapest option for real teletext.
		</p>
		<p>
		Droidfax is a handy javascript viewer that you can embed on a web page. Oh look, there is Droidfax running on your left!
		</p>
		<p>
		You can also export/import between teletext40 and wxTED but this seems to be broken. I'll get on with fixing that now.
		</p>
		
		An older project is <a href="http://teastop.co.uk/vbit-pi/">VBIT-Pi</a> with custom hardware. The big advantage of this design is that
		it generates genlocked teletext so you can overlay teletext on any video source. This is
		especially useful for any mixed video/text effect such as in subtitles and newsflashes.
		The CAD and code are freely available but units are not easy to make.
		</p>
		<p>
		Much easier to make is Alistair Buxton's remarkably economical design.
		Again I don't think that there are any ready made units so you will need to build it yourself.
