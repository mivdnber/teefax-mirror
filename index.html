		<h1>You are viewing pages from Fringefax</h1>
		To navigate the pages, either press a colour button or type the number in directly<br/><br/>
		If there is anything you'd like to see added to Fringefax then please email your ideas to peterk.vt80@gmail.com.<br/><br/>
		You can also create your own pages by using this online <a href="http://editor.teletext40.com/">editor</a><br/>
		When you have designed a page, bookmark it to save it and then copy the URL and send it to the above address.<br/><br/>
		If you are more ambitious you can use <a href="http://teastop.co.uk/teletext/wxted/">wxTED</a>, which is a Windows application.
		It has support for most teletext features.<br/><br/>
		If you would like to view teletext on an old TV then try the Raspberry Pi project. This project takes these pages
		and sends them to a TV. The cost is about £60 consisting of £50 for a Raspberry Pi and £10 for software and cables. Again
		if you would like to try this then drop an email to the address above.
