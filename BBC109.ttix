OL,4,CTrout has an identity crisis in China
OL,5, If you think there's something fishy
OL,6, about the salmon you're eating, that
OL,7, could be because it's not salmon. 
OL,9,FNew rules introduced in China mean
OL,10,Frainbow trout can now be labelled and
OL,11,Fsold domestically as salmon.
OL,13,FWhy? Because a media report earlier
OL,14,Fthis year caused a splash by revealing
OL,15,Fthat rainbow trout had for years been
OL,16,Flabelled as the similar-looking fish.
OL,18,FAuthorities decided that instead of
OL,19,Fbanning the practice, the best solution
OL,20,Fwould be to legitimise it.
