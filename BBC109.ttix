OL,4,CSwiss soldier on trial for fighting IS
OL,5, Johan Cosar went to Syria not to fight
OL,6, for the Islamic State group, but
OL,7, against them. Now, the former Swiss
OL,8, army officer is facing a military
OL,9, tribunal back home.
OL,11,FHe is charged with joining a foreign
OL,12,Farmy and thus undermining Switzerland's
OL,13,Fneutrality and security.
OL,15,FMr Cosar makes no attempt to hide his
OL,16,Factions and remains proud of them. 
OL,18,F"The law forbids fighting for a foreign
OL,19,Fforce," an army spokeswoman said. "Who
OL,20,Fthat force actually is, is irrelevant."
