OL,4,CJohnson: No 10's customs plans 'crazy'
OL,5, Boris Johnson has described one of No
OL,6, 10's proposals for a post-Brexit
OL,7, customs arrangement as "crazy".
OL,9,FA "customs partnership", thought to be
OL,10,Ffavoured by the PM, would involve the
OL,11,FUK collecting import tariffs on behalf
OL,12,Fof the EU.
OL,14,FIn a Daily Mail interview, the foreign
OL,15,Fsecretary said it would limit the UK's
OL,16,Fability to do post-Brexit trade deals.
OL,18,FNo 10 said the idea was still on the
OL,19,Ftable after ministers failed to agree a
OL,20,Fcustoms plan last week.
