OL,4,CUS: China 'not a currency manipulator'
OL,5, The United States has refrained from
OL,6, labelling China a "currency
OL,7, manipulator" in a move which may help
OL,8, defuse escalating tension over trade
OL,9, between the two countries.

OL,12,Faccused China of keeping its currency
OL,13,Fweak to make exports more competitive.
OL,15,FSpeculation that the US Treasury would
OL,16,Fmake that claim formally this week has
OL,17,Fnot been borne out, however.
OL,19,FChina's policies were still of
OL,20,F"particular concern" the Treasury said.
