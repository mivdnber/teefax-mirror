OL,7, after saying he would be "incapable" of
OL,8, loving a woman aged 50 or above...
OL,9, despite being 50 himself.
OL,11,FYann Moix told Marie Claire magazine he
OL,12,Ffound women of that age "too old".
OL,14,F"I prefer younger women's bodies,
OL,15,Fthat's all. End of. The body of a
OL,16,F25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The
OL,17,Fbody of a woman of 50 is not
OL,18,Fextraordinary at all," he said.
