OL,6,CSO WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?              
OL,7,FI'm reviewing the first track on every 
OL,8,Falbum in theBNOW That's What I Call    
OL,9,BMusic!Fseries.                         
OL,11,CBUT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, WHY?          
OL,12,FI've always been fascinated by the     
OL,13,Fsingles charts, andBNOWFencapsulates   
OL,14,Fthem more or less perfectly. Some      
OL,15,Fclaim the Spotify age makesBNOWFless   
OL,16,Ffashionable than it used to be, but    
OL,17,Fit still sells by the truckload.BNOW   
OL,18,F98, the latest as I write, has shifted 
OL,19,Fover 600,000, and the average home owns
OL,20,Ffour from the series. There will be 100
OL,21,FmainBNOWFalbums by this summer, so why 
OL,22,Fnot review how they began (and begin)?

OL,6,CBUT WHY NOW? AS IN, WHY DO THIS... NOW?
OL,7,FSynchronicity with BBC Four's TOTP     
OL,8,Frepeats? Placating a long-suffering    
OL,9,Fwife who'd appreciate me actuallyEdoing
OL,10,Fsomething with my collected CDs? Maybe.
OL,11,FBut also, I want to strike a blow for  
OL,12,Fthe carefully curated mix of tracks,   
OL,13,Fand take a stand against algorithmic,  
OL,14,Frecommendation-powered culture. This   
OL,15,Fis what they want! No wonder Mark      
OL,16,FZuckerberg is out of work!             
OL,17,F                                       
OL,18,CGO ON THEN. HOW WILL THIS ALL PAN OUT? 
OL,19,FStart at track 1, side 1,BNOWF1. Next, 
OL,20,Fthe first track onBNOWF2. End once we  
OL,21,Freach the then-currentBNOW.FAfterwards?
OL,22,FDunno. Er... track one, side two?
