OL,5,CWAIT, WHAT? SURELY YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS. 
OL,6,FYes, this is a project to rate and     
OL,7,Freview every single track in theBNOW   
OL,8,BThat's What I Call Music!Fseries. Every
OL,9,Flast song, on every double album.      
OL,11,CBUT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, WHY?          
OL,12,FI like pop, I've always been fascinated
OL,13,Fby the singles charts, and I love the  
OL,14,BNOW!Fseries. It's very nearly a relic  
OL,15,Fof a broadcast-era past, when Paul     
OL,16,FYoung and PM Dawn nestled together, and
OL,17,Fserendipitous discoveries were made by 
OL,18,Flistening to Bruno Brookes on Radio 1  
OL,19,Fon Sunday early evening. ButBNOW!Fstill
OL,20,Fhas a relevance, and sells by the      
OL,21,Ftruckload. Number 95, the latest as of 
OL,22,Fwriting, shifted nearly a million, and 
OL,23,Fwas 2016's best-selling album.

OL,5,CBUT WHY NOW? AS IN, WHY DO THIS... NOW?
OL,6,FWorking through a mid-life crisis?     
OL,7,FSynchronicity with BBC Four's TOTP     
OL,8,Frepeats? Placating a long-suffering    
OL,9,Fwife who'd appreciate me actuallyEdoing
OL,10,Fsomething with my collected CDs? Maybe.
OL,11,FBut also it's striking a blow for the  
OL,12,Fcarefully curated bundle of tracks, and
OL,13,Ftaking a stand against algorithmic,    
OL,14,FNetflix-recommendation-powered culture.
OL,15,FThis is what they want! No wonder      
OL,16,FMark Zuckerberg is out of work!        
OL,17,F                                       
OL,18,CGO ON THEN. HOW WILL THIS ALL PAN OUT? 
OL,19,FStart at track 1, side 1,BNOW! 1.FEnd  
OL,20,Fwhen caught up. At three reviews a week
OL,21,FI'll have reached the currentBNOW!F(and
OL,22,Fthey'll make more) in... um... the year
OL,23,F2040. Best keep popping those vitamins.

OL,5,CYOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT RATINGS?      
OL,6,FMarks out of ten, dependent on a good  
OL,7,Fmelody line, decent vocals, me getting 
OL,8,Fenough sleep, and various other highly 
OL,9,Fsubjective factors. If you don't expect
OL,10,Fconsistency, you won't be disappointed.
OL,11,F                                       
OL,12,CWHICH VERSIONS OF THE ALBUMS?          
OL,13,FThe fullest commonly available formats,
OL,14,Fso I'll start off with the LPs/tapes   
OL,15,Fthen switch to CDs fromBNOW! 10Fonwards
OL,16,Fincluding any extra tracks.

OL,18,CI DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET. YOU ARE...? 
OL,19,FOh, sorry. I'm Rhys. Within me beats   
OL,20,Fthe poptimistic heart of a classically-
OL,21,Fraised music geek who doesn't believe  
OL,22,Fin genre boundaries. Want to chat? I'm 
OL,23,Erhys@newydd.netF- and many thanks.
