OL,4,CPipeline project gets regulator support
OL,5, Canada's national energy regulator has
OL,6, recommended the Trans Mountain pipeline
OL,7, project receive federal approval. 
OL,9,FThe National Energy Board (NEB) says
OL,10,Fthe project is in the public interest
OL,11,Fdespite posing "significant" harm to
OL,12,Fthe local killer whale population. 
OL,14,FIt said the oil project is justified
OL,15,Fbased on its economic benefits. 
OL,17,FThe regulator was asked last year to
OL,18,Frevisit its recommendations of the
OL,19,Fcontroversial project after a federal
OL,20,Fcourt quashed an earlier approval.
