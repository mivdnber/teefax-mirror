OL,4,CSwiss court orders historic vote re-run
OL,5, The result of a nationwide referendum
OL,6, has been overturned for the first time
OL,7, in modern Switzerland's history. 
OL,9,FThe poll, held in February 2016, asked
OL,10,Fthe country's voters whether married
OL,11,Fcouples and co-habiting partners should
OL,12,Fpay the same tax.
OL,14,FVoters rejected the proposal, with
OL,15,F50.8% against and 49.2% in favour.
OL,17,FBut the supreme court has now voided
OL,18,Fthe result on the grounds that voters
OL,19,Fwere not given full information, and
OL,20,Fthe vote must be re-run.
