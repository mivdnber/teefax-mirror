OL,4,CWheat gene map to help 'feed the world'
OL,5, The starting pistol has been fired in a
OL,6, race to develop "climate change
OL,7, resistant" wheat with the publication
OL,8, of a map of the crop's genes.
OL,10,FAn international team of scientists has
OL,11,Fidentified the location of more than
OL,12,F100,000 wheat genes.
OL,14,FThe researchers say the map will
OL,15,Faccelerate the development of new
OL,16,Fstrains to cope with the increased heat
OL,17,Fwaves expected from climate change.
OL,19,FThe research has been published in the
OL,20,Fjournal Science.
