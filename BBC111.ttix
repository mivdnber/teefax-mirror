OL,4,C'Stark increase' in overweight
OL,5,Cyoungsters
OL,6, There is a "stark" increase between the
OL,7, ages of seven and 11 in the proportion
OL,8, of children in the UK who are
OL,9, overweight or obese, new data suggests.
OL,11,FThe study of nearly 12,000 children
OL,12,Ffound 25% were overweight or obese at
OL,13,Fage seven, rising to 35% at 11.
OL,15,FBetween 11 and 14, there was little
OL,16,Fchange, however, which researchers say
OL,17,Fmay be because children of this age are
OL,18,Fmaking more of their own food choices.
