OL,4,CArgentina raises rates as peso plummets
OL,5, The value of Argentina's peso continued
OL,6, to fall on Thursday, plunging by more
OL,7, than 13% after a 7% drop a day earlier.
OL,9,FThe decline came despite the central
OL,10,Fbank's effort to stabilise the currency
OL,11,Fby raising a key interest rate to 60%.
OL,13,FThe bank said Thursday's rate hike,
OL,14,Ffrom 45% to 60%, was a "response to the
OL,15,Fforeign exchange rate situation and the
OL,16,Frisk of greater inflation".
OL,18,FIt had already increased interest rates
OL,19,Ffour times since April, most recently
OL,20,Fon 13 August.
