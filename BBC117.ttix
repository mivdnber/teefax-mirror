OL,4,C'Bus about to move' warnings ridiculed
OL,5, Bus passengers have criticised
OL,6, Transport for London (TfL) over a
OL,7, "mistimed" announcement designed to
OL,8, stop people falling over on board.
OL,10,FThe warning, "Please hold on, the bus
OL,11,Fis about to move", is supposed to sound
OL,12,Fjust before buses pull away from stops.
OL,14,FBut a technical glitch means many
OL,15,Fwarnings sound after the bus has
OL,16,Fstarted moving.
OL,18,FSome passengers have branded the idea
OL,19,F"annoying and useless", but TfL said it
OL,20,Fwould make journeys safer.
