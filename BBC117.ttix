OL,4,CInside the silent nation of Brunei
OL,5, Brunei has become the focus of global
OL,6, attention for its decision to impose
OL,7, harsh Islamic punishments for offences
OL,8, such as adultery and sodomy - but in
OL,9, the country itself there is silence, as
OL,10, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports.
OL,12,FAt first glance you could be in
OL,13,FSingapore. The roads are smooth and
OL,14,Fwell maintained, the city carefully
OL,15,Flandscaped with plenty of trees and
OL,16,Fspace for pedestrians. 
OL,18,FBandar Seri Bagawan - the capital city
OL,19,Fof Brunei - is safe, orderly and very
OL,20,Fquiet.
