OL,4,C'It's Dr, not Ms,' insists historian
OL,5, When the historian Fern Riddell tweeted
OL,6, on Wednesday that she was "Dr Fern
OL,7, Riddell" not "Ms or Miss Riddell" she
OL,8, was soon met with criticism.
OL,10,FMy title is Dr Fern Riddell, not Ms or
OL,11,FMiss Riddell. I have it because I am an
OL,12,Fexpert, and my life and career consist
OL,13,Fof being that expert in as many
OL,14,Fdifferent ways as possible. I worked
OL,15,Fhard to earned my authority, and I will
OL,16,Fnot give it up to anyone.
