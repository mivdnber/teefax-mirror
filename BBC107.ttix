OL,4,CBarclays Bank charged over Qatar loans
OL,5, The Serious Fraud Office has charged
OL,6, Barclays Bank PLC with "unlawful
OL,7, financial assistance" related to
OL,8, billions of pounds raised from Qatari
OL,9, investors in 2008.
OL,11,FThe same charges were bought against
OL,12,FBarclays PLC in June last year.
OL,14,FThe move to charge Barclays Bank as
OL,15,Fwell is significant because it holds
OL,16,Fthe banking licence that allows it to
OL,17,Foperate in different countries.
OL,19,FSo, if Barclays was found guilty, it
OL,20,Fcould lose that crucial licence.
