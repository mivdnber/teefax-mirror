OL,4,CEmbryo breakthrough 'can save rhino'
OL,5, The seemingly "disastrous" story of the
OL,6, world's most endangered mammal - the
OL,7, northern white rhino - could be
OL,8, rewritten by IVF, scientists claim. 
OL,10,FThey used the method to produce rhino
OL,11,Fembryos with sperm from two dead males.
OL,13,FThe embryos were made using eggs from a
OL,14,Fclosely related sub-species, but the
OL,15,Fscientists say the method could save
OL,16,Fthe northern white rhino. 
OL,18,FOne of the team said he hoped a baby
OL,19,Fthat's fully northern white rhino would
OL,20,Fbe born "within three years".
