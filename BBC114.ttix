OL,4,CUS judge defends rape accused from
OL,5,C'good family'
OL,6, An appeals court has criticised a judge
OL,7, who ruled that a 16-year-old accused of
OL,8, rape should not be tried in an adult
OL,9, court as he was from a "good family"
OL,10, and attended an "excellent school".
OL,12,FThe boy allegedly shared with friends a
OL,13,Fvideo of him raping the girl, along
OL,14,Fwith the text: "When your first time
OL,15,Fhaving sex is rape."
OL,17,FThe judge disputed whether the alleged
OL,18,Fattack was actually rape.
