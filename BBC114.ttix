OL,4,CAiling Algerian leader seeks fifth term
OL,5, Algeria's 81-year-old President
OL,6, Abdelaziz Bouteflika will seek a fifth
OL,7, term in April's elections, he announced
OL,8, in a message published by state media.
OL,10,FMr Bouteflika has been in office for 20
OL,11,Fyears but has rarely been seen in
OL,12,Fpublic since he had a stroke in 2013. 
OL,14,FHe insisted his "unwavering desire" to
OL,15,Fserve Algeria allowed him to "transcend
OL,16,Fthe constraints of health concerns".
OL,18,FCritics say this makes it difficult for
OL,19,Fhim to carry out his duties.
