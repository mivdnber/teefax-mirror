OL,4,CManta ray freed from hooks 'doing well'
OL,5, When Freckles the manta ray approached
OL,6, divers Jake Wilton and Monty Halls,
OL,7, they were shocked to see fishing hooks
OL,8, embedded under her right eye.
OL,10,FMore surprising was that she stopped
OL,11,Fnear them, appearing to ask for help.
OL,13,FJake dived down several times, each
OL,14,Ftime swimming up close and removing the
OL,15,Fhooks from her skin. Freckles waited
OL,16,Fpatiently for him to finish.
OL,18,FJake has since checked in on Freckles
OL,19,Fand told BBC News that she's doing
OL,20,Fwell, and may even have recognised him.
