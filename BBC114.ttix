OL,4,CHuge fossil discovery made in China
OL,5, Scientists say they have discovered a
OL,6, "stunning" trove of thousands of
OL,7, fossils on a river bank in China. 
OL,9,FThe fossils are estimated to be about
OL,10,F518 million years old, and are
OL,11,Fparticularly unusual because the soft
OL,12,Fbody tissue of many creatures,
OL,13,Fincluding their skin, eyes, and
OL,14,Finternal organs, have been
OL,15,F"exquisitely" well preserved. 
OL,17,FPalaeontologists have called the
OL,18,Ffindings "mind-blowing" - especially
OL,19,Fbecause more than half the fossils are
OL,20,Fpreviously undiscovered species.
