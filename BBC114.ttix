OL,5, Horses are regularly being "fly-tipped"
OL,6, and left to die by irresponsible
OL,7, owners, the RSPCA has told the Victoria
OL,8, Derbyshire programme.
OL,10,FOne mare had been dumped by the side of
OL,11,Fthe road while trying to give birth, it
OL,12,Fsaid. The mother and foal both died.
OL,14,FThe charity said the problem was partly
OL,15,Fthat horses were cheap to buy but
OL,16,Fexpensive to maintain, especially if
OL,17,Fthey needed veterinary care.
OL,19,FIt said prosecution cases involving
OL,20,Fhorses had risen by 25% since 2015.
