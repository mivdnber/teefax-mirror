OL,5, Good Friday is about to get better for
OL,6, publicans in the Republic of Ireland.
OL,7, Why? Because they can finally toast the
OL,8, holiday with a pint.
OL,10,FFor almost a century, selling alcohol
OL,11,Fhad been banned on Easter Friday - a
OL,12,Flegacy of Ireland's Christian
OL,13,Ftraditions.

OL,16,Fparliament passed new legislation which
OL,17,Fmeans this year will be different.
