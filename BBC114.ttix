OL,4,CHungary's president signs 'slave law'
OL,5, Hungarian president Janos Ader has
OL,6, passed a new law that nearly doubles
OL,7, how much overtime employees can work.
OL,9,FThe law boosts the overtime employers
OL,10,Fcan demand from 250 to 400 hours, while
OL,11,Fpayment can be delayed by three years. 
OL,13,FMr Ader said employees must give
OL,14,Fwritten consent and wouldn't be
OL,15,Fpenalised for refusing extra hours.
OL,17,FIt comes after days of protests in
OL,18,FHungary against the so-called 'slave
OL,19,Flaw,' which Hungary's parliament
OL,20,Fapproved on 12 December.
