OL,4,CLonger beaks in UK birds 'due to
OL,5,Cfeeders'
OL,6, The British love of feeding birds may
OL,7, have caused great tits to evolve longer
OL,8, beaks than their counterparts in
OL,9, Europe, according to an academic study.
OL,10, 
OL,12,FThe study compared the DNA of more than
OL,13,F3,000 birds in the UK and the
OL,14,FNetherlands and established "genetic
OL,15,Fdifferences" in terms of beak lengths.
OL,17,FDifferences evolved over a short period
OL,18,Fand could be down to higher numbers of
OL,19,Fgarden bird feeders in the UK, it said.
