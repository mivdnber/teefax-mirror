OL,4,CDyslexia eye link spotted by scientists
OL,5, French scientists say they may have
OL,6, found a potential cause of dyslexia
OL,7, which could be treatable, hidden in
OL,8, tiny cells in the human eye.
OL,10,FIn a small study they found that most
OL,11,Fdyslexics had dominant round spots in
OL,12,Fboth eyes - rather than in just one -
OL,13,Fleading to blurring and confusion.
OL,15,FUK experts said the research was "very
OL,16,Fexciting" and highlighted the link
OL,17,Fbetween vision and dyslexia.
OL,19,FBut they said not all dyslexics were
OL,20,Flikely to have the same problem.
