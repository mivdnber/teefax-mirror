OL,5, Nasa believes it has fixed a
OL,6, malfunction with the Hubble telescope
OL,7, which threatened to limit the orbiting
OL,8, observatory's performance.
OL,10,FEarlier this month, one of Hubble's
OL,11,Fgyros - needed to point the spacecraft
OL,12,F- failed, forcing controllers to place
OL,13,Fthe telescope in "safe mode" - where it
OL,14,Foperates with essential functions only.
OL,16,FThis was required because a backup gyro
OL,17,Falso malfunctioned when switched on.
OL,19,FBut after a series of tests, the backup
OL,20,Fappears to be working normally.
