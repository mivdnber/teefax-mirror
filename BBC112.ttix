OL,4,CModern students 'prefer work to drugs'
OL,5, Students are more likely to want
OL,6, universities to take a tougher line
OL,7, against drugs on campus, rather than a
OL,8, more liberal response, say researchers.
OL,10,FThe study - from the Higher Education
OL,11,FPolicy Institute (Hepi) and the
OL,12,FUniversity of Buckingham - found 71% of
OL,13,Fstudents had not taken illegal drugs.
OL,15,FBut almost 40% thought their university
OL,16,Fhad a "problem" with drug use.
OL,18,FHepi's director, Nick Hillman, said
OL,19,Fstudents were "more hardworking and
OL,20,Fless hedonistic" than was realised.
