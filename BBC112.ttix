OL,4,CPolice launch 'creepy' search for woman
OL,5, Berlin Police have been called "creepy"
OL,6, and "stalkerish" for asking social
OL,7, media to help them track down a woman.
OL,9,FThe Instagram post, posted to the
OL,10,Fforce's official account, says the
OL,11,Fwoman asked an officer for directions.
OL,13,F"Your smile has enchanted him," it says
OL,14,Fin German. "He cannot get you out of
OL,15,Fhis head... Now he is looking for you."
OL,17,FBut the post hasn't quite had the
OL,18,Fdesired effect. Instead, it's prompted
OL,19,Fwomen to write about their own
OL,20,Funcomfortable experiences with police.
