OL,4,CSaudi woman 'barred from marrying
OL,5,Cmusician'
OL,6, A Saudi woman has reportedly lost a
OL,7, legal battle to marry the man of her
OL,8, choice after her family objected
OL,9, because he played a musical instrument.
OL,11,FRelatives of the woman, a bank manager,
OL,12,Frefused to allow her to wed the man, a
OL,13,Fteacher, saying his oud (lute) playing
OL,14,Fmade them "religiously incompatible".
OL,16,FA lower court backed that view, and its
OL,17,Fverdict has now been confirmed at
OL,18,Fappeal, a lawyer and local media say.
