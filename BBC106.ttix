OL,5, India has scrapped its 12% tax on all
OL,6, sanitary products following months of

OL,10,Fgovernment introduced the tax, known as
OL,11,FGST, on all goods - including the 12%
OL,12,Fduty on menstrual hygiene products.
OL,14,FCampaigners argued the tax would make
OL,15,Fthem even more unaffordable in a

OL,17,Ffive women and girls already have no
OL,18,Faccess to items like sanitary pads.
