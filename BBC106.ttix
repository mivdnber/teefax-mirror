OL,6, Three Native American prisoners in
OL,7, Texas have successfully sued the
OL,8, state's prison system for the right to
OL,9, grow long hair for religious reasons.

OL,12,Finmates but could affect the more than
OL,13,F5,000 Native American prisoners in the
OL,14,Fstate, the Houston Chronicle reported.

OL,17,Fthem to their creators, but the state
OL,18,Fsaid it would pose a security threat.
