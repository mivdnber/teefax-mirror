OL,4,  How do you know if you are holding a  
OL,5,  decent instrument or a piece of junk? 
OL,6,                                        
OL,7,F Is the ukulele set up correctly? The  
OL,8,F neck should be flat. There should be  
OL,9,F no warp or curve to it. The strings   
OL,10,F should be close over the frets so you 
OL,11,F can press them easily but not so close
OL,12,F that notes buzz.                      
OL,13,                                        
OL,14,F Try playing the open strings then bend
OL,15,F the neck up and down. If tunings go up
OL,16,F and down at the same time then there  
OL,17,F may be a problem.                     
OL,18,F G                                     
OL,19,F Beware of cracks and splits especially
OL,20,F on the neck joint and the bridge.     
OL,21,F A geared machine head will keep tune  
OL,22,F better than friction pegs.G      113->
