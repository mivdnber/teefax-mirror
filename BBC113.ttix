OL,4,CBird seen becoming new species
OL,5, A population of finches on the
OL,6, Galapagos has been discovered in the
OL,7, process of becoming a new species. 
OL,9,FThis is the first example of speciation
OL,10,Fthat scientists have been able to
OL,11,Fobserve directly in the field. 
OL,13,FResearchers followed the entire
OL,14,Fpopulation of finches on a tiny
OL,15,FGalapagos island called Daphne Major,
OL,16,Ffor many years, and so they were able
OL,17,Fto watch the speciation in progress.
OL,19,FThe research was published in the
OL,20,Fjournal Science.
