OL,8,  Teletext has been in the heart of     
OL,9,  Stroud for decades. In the 1970s MRG  
OL,10,  Systems started by manufacturing a    
OL,11,  Wireless World design for a decoder.  
OL,12,                                        
OL,13,  As well as supplying broadcasters     
OL,14,  across the globe it also made systems 
OL,15,  for displaying information to banks,  
OL,16,  cinemas and even air traffic control. 
OL,17,  All of this was delivered in teletext.
OL,18,                                        
OL,19,  All of this came to an end with the   
OL,20,  shutdown of analogue TV transmission.

OL,8,  The last teletext equipment was       
OL,9,  ironically made to help with the      
OL,10,  BBC's analogue shutdown.It included   
OL,11,  many inserters, teletext monitors and 
OL,12,  also an information system used for   
OL,13,  scheduling called Presfax.            
OL,14,                                        
OL,15,  When the last analogue transmitter was
OL,16,  turned off then most of the teletext  
OL,17,  kit was also disposed of.             
OL,18,                                        
OL,19,  Teletext is not quite dead at the BBC 
OL,20,  because although Ceefax has gone,     
OL,21,  Presfax is still used internally.
