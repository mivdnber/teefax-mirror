OL,4,CDoes 5G pose health risks?
OL,5, The 5G mobile network has been switched
OL,6, on in some UK cities and has led to

OL,14,F5G networks rely on signals carried by
OL,15,Fradio waves - part of the
OL,16,Felectromagnetic spectrum - transmitted
OL,17,Fbetween an antenna or mast and your
OL,18,Fphone.
