OL,4,CRussians search for answers after new
OL,5,Csea tragedy
OL,6, One of the first stories I ever
OL,7, reported on in Russia was a submarine
OL,8, disaster. 
OL,10,FIn August 2000, two explosions sent the
OL,11,F17,000 tonne nuclear-powered Kursk to
OL,12,Fthe bottom of the Barents Sea and took
OL,13,F118 submariners down to their deaths. I
OL,14,Fwill never forget the sense of national
OL,15,Fshock and anger at what was widely
OL,16,Fperceived as a slow response by the
OL,17,Fauthorities, a botched operation to
OL,18,Fsave the crew, and a flood of
OL,19,Fdisinformation around the incident.
