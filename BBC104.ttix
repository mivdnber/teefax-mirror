OL,4,CUniversal Credit 'not value for money'
OL,5, The government's flagship benefits
OL,6, system has been too slow to roll out,
OL,7, causes hardship, and is not delivering
OL,8, value for money, a watchdog has said.
OL,10,FThe National Audit Office said the
OL,11,FB#1.9bn Universal Credit system could
OL,12,Fend up costing more to administer than
OL,13,Fthe benefits system it is replacing. 
OL,15,FSome claimants waited eight months for
OL,16,Fpayment amid the switch to UC, which
OL,17,Frolls six benefits into one, it adds.
OL,19,FThe government said UC would bring a
OL,20,FB#34bn return over 10 years.
