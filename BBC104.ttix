OL,5, Tory MPs have rallied round Theresa May
OL,6, after her conference speech on
OL,7, Wednesday was marred by mishaps.

OL,10,Fthe PM for contending with a persistent
OL,11,Fcough and a prankster. John Redwood
OL,12,Fsaid MPs backed her "strong message".
OL,14,FHowever, it is thought that dozens of
OL,15,FMPs are discussing the possibility of
OL,16,Ftrying to persuade Mrs May to stand
OL,17,Faside.
