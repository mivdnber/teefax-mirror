OL,4,CUS to end Iran oil sanctions exemptions
OL,5, US President Donald Trump has decided
OL,6, to end exemptions from sanctions for
OL,7, countries still buying oil from Iran.
OL,9,FThe White House said waivers for China,
OL,10,FIndia, Japan, South Korea and Turkey
OL,11,Fwould expire in May, after which they
OL,12,Fcould face US sanctions themselves.
OL,14,FThis decision is intended to bring
OL,15,FIran's oil exports to zero, denying the
OL,16,Fgovernment its main source of revenue.
OL,18,FIran insisted the sanctions were
OL,19,Fillegal and that it had attached "no
OL,20,Fvalue or credibility" to the waivers.
