OL,5, President Donald Trump has vetoed a
OL,6, measure from Congress revoking his
OL,7, declaration of a national emergency at
OL,8, the US-Mexico border.
OL,10,FLawmakers, including 12 Republicans,
OL,11,Fhad passed the rejection resolution on
OL,12,FThursday in a surprising rebuke of Mr
OL,13,FTrump's pledge to build a border wall.
OL,15,FCongress will now need a two-thirds
OL,16,Fmajority in both chambers to override
OL,17,Fhim, which is unlikely to happen.
OL,19,FThis is the first veto of Mr Trump's
OL,20,Fpresidency.
