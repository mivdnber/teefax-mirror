OL,4,CShould parents ban Horrid Henry?
OL,5, Emmerdale actor Adam Thomas has banned
OL,6, his three-year-old son from watching
OL,7, Horrid Henry because he says Teddy has
OL,8, "literally turned into" the fictional
OL,9, character. But should parents be
OL,10, banishing him from their children's
OL,11, lives?
OL,13,FHenry is a naughty prankster who
OL,14,Fbullies his little brother and causes
OL,15,Fchaos wherever he goes. Henry is just,
OL,16,Fwell, horrid.

OL,19,Fcreation, telling the BBC that in the
OL,20,Fend "he always obeys his parents".
