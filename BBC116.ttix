OL,4,CWhy rich convicts hire prison
OL,5,Cconsultants
OL,6, Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen is
OL,7, turning himself in on Monday - and we
OL,8, may see more headline convicts behind
OL,9, bars in the near future as cases like
OL,10, the college admissions scandal wind
OL,11, through the justice system. When the
OL,12, rich leave their luxury mansions for a
OL,13, spell in the big house, they sometimes
OL,14, turn to specialised consultants to
OL,15, cushion the blow of prison life.
