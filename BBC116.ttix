OL,4,CJapanese Emperor Akihito's human touch
OL,5, On a beautiful spring morning last
OL,6, week, I stood on a street corner on the
OL,7, western outskirts of Tokyo. For
OL,8, hundreds of metres in each direction,
OL,9, the road was lined, three-deep, with
OL,10, eager, excited faces. Then, with almost
OL,11, no warning, a large black limousine
OL,12, approached over a bridge, motorcycle
OL,13, outriders on either side. 
OL,15,FAs the car slipped by, for a few brief
OL,16,Fmoments, we could see Emperor Akihito
OL,17,Fand Empress Michiko leaning forward
OL,18,Fwaving gently. A ripple of applause and
OL,19,Fwaving of plastic flags from the crowd,
OL,20,Fand they were gone.
