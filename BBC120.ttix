OL,4,CMy friend, the mayor of Mogadishu
OL,5, It was late afternoon in Mogadishu, a
OL,6, few years back, and a bleary-eyed man
OL,7, in a dishevelled uniform was blocking
OL,8, my way - and brandishing a grenade.
OL,10,FIt seemed an odd choice of weapon. But
OL,11,Fthat was hardly the point. 
OL,13,FI reached, slowly, for my phone, and
OL,14,Fcalled a friend for help.
OL,16,FI knew Engineer Yarisow would answer.
OL,17,FHe always did. And I knew he would sort
OL,18,Fthings out - that was his speciality.
