OL,5, Gabrielle Crawford has worked for years
OL,6, as a professional photographer. Now
OL,7, living in Normandy she was puzzled by
OL,8, how few people took an interest in
OL,9, France's monuments to the dead of two
OL,10, world wars. So, having secured a
OL,11, commission, she set about creating a
OL,12, photo collection of the monuments -
OL,13, trying to bring a female perspective to
OL,14, these commemorative works of art.
OL,16,FGabrielle (who was once married to the
OL,17,Factor Michael Crawford of Some Mothers
OL,18,FDo 'Ave 'Em fame ) remembers being
OL,19,Faware of war monuments even when she
OL,20,Fwas very young.
