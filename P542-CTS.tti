OL,5, In need of some escapism... have a     
OL,6, deadline to meet at midnight tonight   
OL,7, (Wed 19 Oct at 2359:59) which means if 
OL,8, I don't get the data in, armageddon    
OL,9, will kick in. Bit of a shame really, am
OL,10, doing really well at the moment.       
OL,12, In other areas, lessons are just nicer 
OL,13, to teach, getting on top of marking,   
OL,14, planning even better lessons, thinking 
OL,15, how to improve on present best, that   
OL,16, sort of thing.                         
OL,18, Mmmm... there might be an audience for 
OL,19, a new teletext soap-opera, the first   
OL,20, one since 1988. And why not? There     
OL,21, might be some interest in it :-)
