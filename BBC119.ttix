OL,4,CWhy I prefer Christmas Eve to Christmas
OL,5,CDay
OL,6, It can sometimes seem as though the
OL,7, whole Christmas season is about a
OL,8, single day. For poet Ian McMillan,
OL,9, though, the most special date in the
OL,10, festive calendar is 24 December.
OL,12,FI like Christmas Eve much more than
OL,13,FChristmas Day - I always have. I enjoy
OL,14,Fthe anticipation and the excitement
OL,15,Fand, because I'm a Yorkshireman, I love
OL,16,Fthe tremblingly beautiful idea of the
OL,17,Fdeferred gratification. With added
OL,18,Fbaubles.
