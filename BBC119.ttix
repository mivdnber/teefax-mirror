OL,4,CShetland pony's emergency car trip
OL,5, An Orkney farmer took extreme measures
OL,6, when her Shetland pony suffered a
OL,7, cracked tooth.
OL,9,FThe pony, named Rubee, needed to see a
OL,10,Fspecialist vet for treatment and the
OL,11,Fquickest way to get her there was in
OL,12,Fthe back of her owner's car.
OL,14,FDrivers were stunned to see the tiny
OL,15,Fanimal peering out of the car window on
OL,16,Fher way to Kirkwall.
OL,18,FThe 22-inch pony seemed content with
OL,19,Fthe unconventional mode of transport
OL,20,Fbut left a "gift" in the boot.
