OL,4,CWho will compensate Zimbabwe's white
OL,5,Cfarmers?
OL,6, In Zimbabwe, thousands of white farmers
OL,7, were forced from their farms, sometimes
OL,8, violently, between 2000 and 2001 under
OL,9, a government programme of land reform.
OL,10, The seizures were blamed for destroying
OL,11, Zimbabwe's economy, and ruined
OL,12, relations with the West. A new plan to
OL,13, compensate the farmers could restore
OL,14, donor confidence but it has divided the
OL,15, country, as the BBC's Shingai Nyoka
OL,16, reports.
