OL,4,CSky-Fox deal 'not in public interest'
OL,5, Fox's proposed takeover of Sky is not
OL,6, in the public interest on grounds of
OL,7, media plurality, the UK's Competition
OL,8, and Markets Authority (CMA) has said.
OL,10,FThe CMA has provisionally found that if
OL,11,Fthe deal went ahead as planned, it
OL,12,Fwould give the Murdoch family too much
OL,13,Fcontrol over news providers in the UK.
OL,15,FHowever, the CMA found the deal would
OL,16,Fnot be against the public interest on
OL,17,Fthe grounds of  broadcasting standards.
OL,19,FFox has been trying to buy the 61% of
OL,20,FSky that it does not currently own.
