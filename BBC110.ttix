OL,4,CUS court stays execution over imam row
OL,5, A federal appeals court has blocked the
OL,6, execution of a Muslim inmate in Alabama
OL,7, after the state refused to allow his
OL,8, imam to be present at his death.
OL,10,FDomineque Ray, convicted of murdering a
OL,11,F15-year-old girl in 1995, was scheduled
OL,12,Ffor execution on Thursday.
OL,14,FBut his lawyers argued that the state
OL,15,Finfringed on his religious rights by
OL,16,Fdenying his request for an imam over a
OL,17,Fchaplain during the execution.
OL,19,FThe state has now appealed the stay to
OL,20,Fthe US Supreme Court.
