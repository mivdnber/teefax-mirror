OL,5,Cgenius
OL,6, It's almost 30 years since Jean-Michel
OL,7, Basquiat died in New York. Aged just
OL,8, 27, he'd been acclaimed as a major
OL,9, visual artist with roots in street
OL,10, graffiti. Now a big exhibition of his
OL,11, work has opened at the Barbican in
OL,12, London. His friend Jennifer Stein
OL,13, remembers working with Basquiat in the
OL,14, early days - which she thinks were his
OL,15, happiest.
