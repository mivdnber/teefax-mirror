OL,5, Every person receiving Personal
OL,6, Independence Payments (PIP) is to have

OL,10,FDepartment for Work and Pensions not to
OL,11,Fchallenge a court ruling saying changes
OL,12,Fto PIP - which limited the support
OL,13,Freceived by people with mental health
OL,14,Fconditions - were unfair.
