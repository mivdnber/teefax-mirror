OL,4,CBees in plane's engine delay flights
OL,5, A swarm of bees flew into the engine of
OL,6, a Mango Airlines plane, forcing a delay
OL,7, in flights at the main airport in South
OL,8, Africa's coastal city of Durban. 
OL,10,FBee experts were called in and they
OL,11,Fsafely removed the estimated 20,000
OL,12,Fbees from the engine, the low-budget
OL,13,Fairline said. 
OL,15,FThe incident was extremely unusual, and
OL,16,Fthe bees were probably resting before
OL,17,Fplanning to fly on, one expert said. 
OL,19,FIt was unlikely they intended to make a
OL,20,F"smelly" engine their home, he added.
