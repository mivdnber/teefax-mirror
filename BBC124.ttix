OL,4,CAre these 00s singers still relevant?
OL,5, Earlier this week, Kate Nash took to
OL,6, Twitter to criticise BuzzFeed for their
OL,7, article about noughties singers who are
OL,8, no longer in the charts.
OL,10,FThe listicle features 33 artists who
OL,11,F"only exist in the memories of British
OL,12,Fmillennials", but Nash was quick to
OL,13,Fargue that a lack of recent chart
OL,14,Fsuccess doesn't stop them from being
OL,15,Factive or credible musicians.
OL,17,F"I have huge problems with how the
OL,18,Findustry disposes of artists," she
OL,19,Ftweeted, "it's a difficult career to
OL,20,Fmaintain."
