OL,4,CSeals colonise beach closed in shutdown
OL,5, A large herd of elephant seals has
OL,6, taken over a beach in California that
OL,7, was forced to close during the
OL,8, government shutdown.
OL,10,FThe seals took advantage of the 35-day
OL,11,Fshutdown to make themselves at home on
OL,12,FDrakes Beach, and in its car park.
OL,14,FSo far they have been spotted lying on
OL,15,Ftheir stomachs, taking naps and
OL,16,Foccasionally snuggling their pups.
OL,18,FThe beach will remain closed until the
OL,19,Fseals decide to move on - although it's
OL,20,Fnot clear when that will be.
