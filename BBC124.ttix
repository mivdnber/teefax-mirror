OL,4,CNew tech lets submarines 'email' planes
OL,5, A way for submerged submarines to
OL,6, communicate with planes has been
OL,7, developed by researchers at MIT.
OL,9,FAt present, it is difficult for planes
OL,10,Fto pick up underwater sonar signals
OL,11,Fbecause they reflect off the water's
OL,12,Fsurface and rarely break through.
OL,14,FThe researchers found an extremely
OL,15,Fhigh-frequency radar could detect tiny
OL,16,Fripples in water, created by an
OL,17,Fordinary underwater speaker.
OL,19,FThis could let lost flight recorders
OL,20,Fand submarines communicate with planes.
