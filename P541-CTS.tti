OL,6, Teletext was a very significant part of
OL,7, my growing-up. We got our first        
OL,8, teletext TV in Nov 1987, to replace an 
OL,9, irreparable Philips G8 Colour TV.      
OL,11, All I knew about teletext was the in-  
OL,12, vision broadcasts on BBC2. My brother  
OL,13, showed me how to interact with teletext
OL,14, through page numbers and I was wowed.  
OL,16, Later I discovered subtitles on page   
OL,17, 888. Speech-to-text amazed me. This    
OL,18, helped to improve my reading, writing, 
OL,19, spelling and grammar at school. I even 
OL,20, modelled my handwriting by the teletext
OL,21, characters.

OL,6, Somehow I was influenced that Oracle   
OL,7, was the better service than Ceefax.    
OL,8, Back then you were either a Children's 
OL,9, ITV or BBC viewer.                     
OL,11,C"Wow! How did you do that?!"           
OL,12, My party trick was knowing all the page
OL,13, by heart, as quizzed intensively by my 
OL,14, brother's mates (I thought I was 'just'
OL,15, clever). I knew even Oracle's hidden   
OL,16, test pages.                            
OL,18, Televox is another story. Dad never    
OL,19, worked out why his phone bill once was 
OL,20, suddendly expensive and to this day    
OL,21, he still doesn't know (is it time?)

OL,6, I remember when Ceefax opened all six  
OL,7, magazines in Nov 1989. It had Breakfast
OL,8, Daytime and Evening editions. In the   
OL,9, previous month, C4 subtitled a whole   
OL,10, day's programming, which was novel back
OL,11, then. I convinced mum I had a belly    
OL,12, ache and stayed home from school.      
OL,14, There was talk about the IBA selling   
OL,15, some lines on the VBI in 1989, I didn't
OL,16, get it then. but in 1991, it was       
OL,17, announced Oracle had lost the franchise
OL,19, For an 11 year old, I did my best to   
OL,20, make sense of it all. Was only until I 
OL,21, grew up and realised what had happened.

OL,6, It became apparent that Oracle was to  
OL,7, close at midnight of 31 Dec 1992. I    
OL,8, observed the closedown process.        
OL,10, I watched Teletext UK turn on their    
OL,11, service, which took about 40 minutes to
OL,12, get it fully working. I frantically    
OL,13, checked all of their test pages until  
OL,14, their new service slowly woke up.      
OL,16, By then I turned 13. What with the     
OL,17, London TV switchover to Carlton and    
OL,18, a new era for Teletext, this was a     
OL,19, milestone for me to move on into my    
OL,20, teenage years.

OL,6, Oracle really was a means for me to    
OL,7, connect with the outside world and     
OL,8, access a wealth of information.        
OL,9, I was interested in horoscopes, TV     
OL,10, listings, news and weather, articles   
OL,11, for the young and what's at the cinema.
OL,13, Speaking for my childhood, Oracle was a
OL,14, reader-friendly service. With its own  
OL,15, soul, I was sad to watch it closedown. 
OL,16, It signified the start of my teenage   
OL,17, years, which meant I got out more and  
OL,18, discovered cars and girls (scrap cars -
OL,19, I preferred home electronics actually).

OL,6, In the early 2000s I discovered old    
OL,7, pages on the Internet, I learned that  
OL,8, SVHS tape recordings were good enough  
OL,9, for teletext retrieval. Those were the 
OL,10, early days of teletext archaeology.    
OL,12, Who would have thought: today I can    
OL,13, write my own set of teletext pages and 
OL,14, send it to a Raspberry Pi for my TV.   
OL,15, This was an old ambition of mine.      
OL,17, I dedicate this piece to Peter Kwan and
OL,18, to all contributors of Teefax and to
