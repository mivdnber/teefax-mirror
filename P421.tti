OL,11,Fgroundbreaking compilation series in

OL,17,Fone, side one. Solid, safe and sensible
OL,18,F(at least in 1983), Phil's a definitive
OL,19,BNOW!Fartist. He'll pop up 12 more times
OL,20,Fon these albums, which says as much

OL,15,Faccept this cover. I'm not entirely    
OL,16,Fconvinced. Yes, the video's audacious: 
OL,17,Fyou don't put three Phils in a row     
OL,18,Fwithout inviting comparison. As        
OL,19,Fcovers go, though, it's thoroughly     
OL,20,Fcompetent, and - whisper it softly -

OL,9,FCollins sings as though the clock's    
OL,10,Fticking. He'd barely have turned thirty
OL,11,Fon recording this, but it's hard not to
OL,12,Fhear an angsty middle-aged panic in his
