OL,11,Fgroundbreaking compilation series in   
OL,12,FNovember '83? A ten-month-old chart

OL,17,Fone, side one. Solid, safe and sensible
OL,18,F(at least in 1983), Phil's a definitive
OL,19,BNOW!Fartist. He'll pop up 12 more times
OL,20,Fon these albums, which says as much

OL,13,Fclaims that listening to The Supremes'

OL,15,Faccept this cover. I'm not entirely    
OL,16,Fconvinced. Yes, the video's audacious: 
OL,17,Fyou don't put three Phils in a row     
OL,18,Fwithout inviting comparison. As        
OL,19,Fcovers go, though, it's thoroughly

OL,9,FCollins sings as though the clock's    
OL,10,Fticking. He'd barely have turned thirty
OL,11,Fon recording this, but it's hard not to
OL,12,Fhear an angsty middle-aged panic in his
OL,13,Fdelivery. A truer video for this might 
OL,14,Fhave him skanking to and from the

OL,7,EPeaked atFNumber 2E(2 weeks, Feb 84)   
OL,9,FOne of the reasons it's taken me ages 
OL,10,Fto do entry number 2 is that it means 
OL,11,Fworking out my opinion on Queen.       
OL,12,F                                       
OL,13,FI mean, it's Queen, y'know? Excellent
OL,14,Fmusicians, undoubtedly. A gift for a  
OL,15,Fgood hook (though not maybe quite as  
OL,16,Fgreat at a whole tune). Their finest  
OL,17,Fmoment was when they outsourced most
OL,18,Fof the heavy lifting to David Bowie.
OL,19,F                                    
OL,20,FAnd they're the ultimate critic-proof
OL,21,Fband. Nothing I say here will change
OL,22,Fyour opinion of them. Just as well.

OL,8,FMaybe it's always a bit cynical to 
OL,9,Fwrite a song like this. It defines
OL,10,F'radio-friendly'. You can't imagine a 
OL,11,FDJ turning it down for any playlist.
OL,12,F                                       
OL,13,FIt's still rather over-sincere. Roger
OL,14,FTaylro makes sure you don't forget 
OL,15,Fthat he loved the radio. But the   
OL,16,Fproduction's plodding, the clapping 
OL,17,Fchorus predictable, and despite the   
OL,18,Fvideo, it's hard to shake the feeling
OL,19,Fthat the wisdom of crowds got it
